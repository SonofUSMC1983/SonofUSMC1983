Dear Kenneth Miller:

Subject: Student Loan Discharge Based on Borrower Defense Evidence

You have been approved for debt relief under the Biden-Harris Administration! This is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to delivering relief to borrowers whose schools engaged in unlawful conduct.

The U.S. Department of Education (ED) has determined that the federal student loan(s) you received to attend The Art Institute on or after Jan. 1, 2004, and on or before Oct. 16, 2017, are eligible for a full discharge. This means the remaining balance on the eligible loan(s) will be forgiven. You do not have to make any more payments on the loan(s).

Your loan(s) will be discharged based on an ED finding that The Art Institutes made pervasive and widespread substantial misrepresentations that borrowers relied on to their detriment. This conduct affected students who enrolled at the Art Institutes from Jan. 1, 2004 through Oct. 16, 2017, when the campuses were sold to Dream Center Education Holdings, LLC. These misrepresentations related to the salaries and employment rates for its graduates and the benefits and connections The Art Institutes provided to students and graduates. Because of the pervasive and widespread nature of the misconduct by The Art Institutes, ED has determined that it is appropriate to discharge the loans made to all students who attended The Art Institutes during the time period described above. Borrowers do not need to file an application for the loans from the Art Institutes during this period to be discharged. You also may receive a refund for prior payments made to ED on the loan(s) being discharged. Your loan servicer will let you know if you are eligible for a payment refund, which may be mailed to you or sent electronically. Please check your online account with your loan servicer to ensure your address is correct so you can receive any refund. Otherwise, you do not have to take any further action to receive your discharge. Your credit report will also be updated to reflect this discharge when it is complete.

If you do not wish to accept this discharge for any reason, including because you are concerned about any possible state tax liability, please contact your loan servicer within 30 days of receiving this letter. Don’t know who your loan servicer is? Log in to StudentAid.gov, find “My Aid,” and select “View loan servicer details.” You also can call us at 1-800-4-FED-AID and we will connect you with your servicer.

It will take ED some time to process your discharge; however, you do not need to make any payments on the loan(s) you received to attend The Art Institute while your discharge is pending. Until ED completes its work, the eligible loan(s) you received to attend The Art Institute will remain paused in forbearance/stopped collections, and we will not ask you to resume making payments. If you have loans in default, we will not attempt to collect on the loan(s) being discharged through this action.

Please note: This letter does not apply to any private student loans you may have. Also, this letter only applies to eligible loan(s) you borrowed to fund an Art Institute enrollment during the timeframe mentioned above; it does not apply to any loans you may have borrowed to attend any other school, and it does not apply to any loans you may have borrowed to fund a separate Art Institute enrollment outside the timeframe mentioned above.

Beware of Scams

You might be contacted by a company saying they will help you get loan discharge, forgiveness, cancellation, or debt relief for a fee. You never have to pay for help with your federal student aid. Make sure you work only with the U.S. Department of Education and our loan servicers, and never reveal your personal information or account password to anyone.

Our emails to borrowers come from noreply@studentaid.gov, noreply@debtrelief.studentaid.gov, or ed.gov@public.govdelivery.com. You can report scam attempts to the Federal Trade Commission by calling 1-877-382-4357 or by visiting reportfraud.ftc.gov.

If you have questions about this notice, please call our borrower defense hotline at 1-855-279-6207. You may visit StudentAid.gov/Contact for our hours of operation.

This letter is NOT an attempt to collect a debt or a demand for any payment.

Sincerely,


Richard Cordray
Chief Operating Officer
Federal Student Aid

Free-space optical communication

Article TalkLanguage"); background-color: rgb(84, 89, 93);">Download PDFWatchEdit

This article is about optical communication over long distances. For short- to medium-range communication, see Optical wireless communications.

Free-space optical communication (FSO) is an optical communication technology that uses light propagating in free space to wirelessly transmit data for telecommunications or computer networking. "Free space" means air, outer space, vacuum, or something similar. This contrasts with using solids such as optical fiber cable.

An 8-beam free-space optics laser link, rated for 1 Gbit/s. The receptor is the large lens in the middle, the transmitters the smaller ones. At the top right corner is a monocular for assisting the alignment of the two heads.

The technology is useful where the physical connections are impractical due to high costs or other considerations.

"); background-color: var(--color-subtle,#54595d); transform: scaleY(-1); margin-right: 6px; max-height: 32px;">Usage and technologiesedit

Free-space point-to-point optical links can be implemented using infrared laser light, although low-data-rate communication over short distances is possible using LEDs. Infrared Data Association (IrDA) technology is a very simple form of free-space optical communications. On the communications side the FSO technology is considered as a part of the optical wireless communications applications. Free-space optics can be used for communications between spacecraft.[5]

Useful distancesedit

The reliability of FSO units has always been a problem for commercial telecommunications. Consistently, studies find too many dropped packets and signal errors over small ranges (400 to 500 metres (1,300 to 1,600 ft)). This is from both independent studies, such as in the Czech Republic,[6] as well as internal studies, such as one conducted by MRV FSO staff.[7]

Military based studies consistently produce longer estimates for reliability, projecting the maximum range for terrestrial links is of the order of 2 to 3 km (1.2 to 1.9 mi).[8] All studies agree the stability and quality of the link is highly dependent on atmospheric factors such as rain, fog, dust and heat. Relays may be employed to extend the range for FSO communications.[9][10]

TMEX USA ran two eight-mile links between Laredo, Texas and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico from 1998[11] to 2002. The links operated at 155 Mbit/s and reliably carried phone calls and internet service.[12][dubious – discuss][citation needed]

Extending the useful distanceedit

DARPA ORCA official concept art created c. 2008

The main reason terrestrial communications have been limited to non-commercial telecommunications functions is fog. Fog often prevents FSO laser links over 500 metres (1,600 ft) from achieving a year-round availability sufficient for commercial services. Several entities are continually attempting to overcome these key disadvantages to FSO communications and field a system with a better quality of service. DARPA has sponsored over US$130 million in research toward this effort, with the ORCA and ORCLE programs.[13][14][15]

Other non-government groups are fielding tests to evaluate different technologies that some claim have the ability to address key FSO adoption challenges. As of October 2014, none have fielded a working system that addresses the most common atmospheric events.

FSO research from 1998 to 2006 in the private sector totaled $407.1 million, divided primarily among four start-up companies. All four failed to deliver products that would meet telecommunications quality and distance standards:[16]

Terabeam received approximately $575 million in funding from investors such as Softbank, Mobius Venture Capital and Oakhill Venture Partners. AT&T and Lucent backed this attempt.[17][18] The work ultimately failed, and the company was purchased in 2004 for $52 million (excluding warrants and options) by Falls Church, Va.-based YDI, effective June 22, 2004, and used the name Terabeam for the new entity. On September 4, 2007, Terabeam (then headquartered in San Jose, California) announced it would change its name to Proxim Wireless Corporation, and change its NASDAQ stock symbol from TRBM to PRXM.[19]AirFiber received $96.1 million in funding, and never solved the weather issue. They sold out to MRV communications in 2003, and MRV sold their FSO units until 2012 when the end-of-life was abruptly announced for the Terescope series.[20]LightPointe Communications received $76 million in start-up funds, and eventually reorganized to sell hybrid FSO-RF units to overcome the weather-based challenges.[21]The Maxima Corporation published its operating theory in Science,[22] and received $9 million in funding before permanently shutting down. No known spin-off or purchase followed this effort.Wireless Excellence developed and launched CableFree UNITY solutions that combine FSO with millimeter wave and radio technologies to extend distance, capacity and availability, with a goal of making FSO a more useful and practical technology.[23]

One private company published a paper on November 20, 2014, claiming they had achieved commercial reliability (99.999% availability) in extreme fog. There is no indication this product is currently commercially available.[24]

Extraterrestrialedit

The massive advantages of laser communication in space have multiple space agencies racing to develop a stable space communication platform, with many significant demonstrations and achievements.

Operational systemsedit

The first gigabit laser-based communication[clarification needed] was achieved by the European Space Agency and called the European Data Relay System (EDRS) on November 28, 2014. The system is operational and is being used on a daily basis.

In December 2023, the Australian National University (ANU) demonstrated its Quantum Optical Ground Station at its Mount Stromlo Observatory. QOGS uses adaptive optics and lasers as part of a telescope, to create a bi-directional communications system capable of supporting the NASA Artemis program to the Moon.[25]

Demonstrationsedit

A two-way distance record for communication was set by the Mercury laser altimeter instrument aboard the MESSENGER spacecraft. It was able to communicate across a distance of 24 million km (15 million mi), as the craft neared Earth on a fly-by in May, 2005. The previous record had been set with a one-way detection of laser light from Earth by the Galileo probe, of 6 million km (3.7 million mi) in 1992.

In January 2013, NASA used lasers to beam an image of the Mona Lisa to the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter roughly 390,000 km (240,000 mi) away. To compensate for atmospheric interference, an error correction code algorithm similar to that used in CDs was implemented.[26]

In the early morning hours of Oct. 18, 2013, NASA's Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration (LLCD) transmitted data from lunar orbit to Earth at a rate of 622 megabits per second (Mbit/s).[27] LLCD was flown aboard the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) spacecraft, whose primary science mission was to investigate the tenuous and exotic atmosphere that exists around the Moon.

Between April and July 2014 NASA's OPALS instrument successfully uploaded 175 megabytes in 3.5 seconds and downloaded 200–300 MB in 20 s.[28] Their system was also able to re-acquire tracking after the signal was lost due to cloud cover.

On Dec. 7, 2021 NASA launched the Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LCRD), which aims to relay data between spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit and ground stations. LCRD is NASA's first two-way, end-to-end optical relay. LCRD uses two ground stations, Optical Ground Station (OGS)-1 and -2, at Table Mountain Observatory in California, and Haleakalā, Hawaii.[29] One of LCRD's first operational users is the Integrated LCRD Low-Earth Orbit User Modem and Amplifier Terminal (ILLUMA-T), on the International Space Station. The terminal will receive high-resolution science data from experiments and instruments on board the space station and then transfer this data to LCRD, which will then transmit it to a ground station. After the data arrives on Earth, it will be delivered to mission operation centers and mission scientists. The ILLUMA-T payload was sent to the ISS in late 2023 on SpaceX CRS-29, and achieved first light on 5 December 2023.[30][31]

On April 28, 2023, NASA and its partners achieved 200 gigabit per second (Gbps) throughput on a space-to-ground optical link between a satellite in orbit and Earth. This was achieved by the TeraByte InfraRed Delivery (TBIRD) system, mounted on NASA's Pathfinder Technology Demonstrator 3 (PTD-3) satellite.[32]

Commercial useedit

Various satellite constellations that are intended to provide global broadband coverage, such as SpaceX Starlink, employ laser communication for inter-satellite links. This effectively creates a space-based optical mesh network between the satellites.
